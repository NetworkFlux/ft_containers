# -- ft_containers --

## Usage (linux only) -- 👈

This project provides a huge tester that compares the output of my containers to the real ones.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetworkFlux/ft_containers.git && cd ft_containers && make
```
To launch the tester :
```bash
bash test.sh
```

## Topics -- 🗝
1. C++
2. Standard Library
3. Containers
4. Vector
5. Map
6. Stack

## Challenge -- 💡
This project is about reimplemanting 3 of the C++ Standard Library, Vector, Map and Stack. Each structures has its own complex optemized data structure. Those containers are expected to have the exact same behaviour as the real ones.

## Objectives -- ✅
- Master C++ language
- Optemize as much (should be as fast as the real ones)
- Learn about complexe data structures and Complexity

## Comments -- ⚙️
This project was pretty hard to do as the standard containers are loaded with functionnalities.
